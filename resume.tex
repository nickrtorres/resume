                    {\sl Operating Systems:} \textit{Unix-like} (GNU/Linux, macOS) \\

\section{Experience}
                {\sl Instructional Student Assistant} \hfill November 2020 -- Present \\
                Assists undergraduate computer science students with topics
                from classes throughout the undergraduate computer science
                curriculum -- topics include programming languages, operating
                systems, and analysis of algorithms.

                {\sl Software Engineer} \hfill May 2018 -- July 2020 \\
                Safran Passenger Innovations, Brea, CA \\
                Worked with a team to design, develop, document, and test
                software for an inflight entertainment system.
                 \begin{itemize}
                    \item Wrote correct libraries and applications in C++.
                    \item Tested software at the unit and integration levels.
                    \item Documented software at all levels from high level
                    overviews to API descriptions.
                    \item Reviewed software, documentation, and tests written
                    by other engineers.
                \end{itemize}
\section{Open Source}
              {\sl \texttt{clippy} --- the Rust linter} \hfill \texttt{https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy}
                 \begin{itemize}
                   \item Proposed and implemented a new lint to catch non-idiomatic use of
                   \texttt{Result}---a common Rust sum type.
                   \item Worked through the pull request process with the
                   project maintainers to integrate the new lint into
                   \texttt{clippy}.
                   \item Contributed documentation fixes and updates.
                 \end{itemize}
\section{Projects}
             {\sl \texttt{Bandera} --- an x86-16 bytecode VM} \hfill \texttt{https://github.com/nickrtorres/bandera}
             A work-in-progress portable x86-16 bytecode virtual machine that
             accepts \textit{MASM} flavored assembly language. Additionally, it accepts
             a subset of DOS's \texttt{int 21h} interrupts -- namely those that
             perform I/O. It uses a recursive descent parser to understand the
             semantics of a \textit{MASM} assembly program and emits bytecode for that
             file to run on its virtual machine.

             {\sl \texttt{rlox} --- a Lox interpreter} \hfill \texttt{https://github.com/nickrtorres/rlox} \\
             A work-in-progress rust port of \texttt{jlox}---Bob Nystrom's Lox interpreter
             written for {\sl Crafting Interpreters}.
